# FGA - Data Science Stream

This repository is used to showcase the assignments I have done for the Fresh Graduate Academy program I signed up for. You will see folders containing exercises I did during class, challenges I completed at the end of every chapter, and (hopefully) the final project I will be making.


# Folders

Currently this repo only has 1 folder in it.

## Challenge 1

In this folder, you can find the data we have to gather insight from and visualize later on, SQL queries I wrote to answer the questions from our instructor, and CSV files containing said queries' results. Here, most of the explanations are written in Indonesian, as it focuses on COVID-19 data in Indonesia.

We were also tasked to make an insightful dashboard using Google Data Studio which can be accessed [here](https://datastudio.google.com/s/jhdgdxTTt18).
