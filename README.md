# FGA - Data Science Stream

This repository is used to showcase the assignments I have done for the Fresh Graduate Academy program I signed up for. You will see folders containing exercises I did during class, challenges I completed at the end of every chapter, and (hopefully) the final project I will be making.


# Folders

Currently this repo has 2 folders in it.

## Exercise week 1

In this exercise, we used [Transjakarta Passengers in 2019](https://data.jakarta.go.id/dataset/data-jumlah-penumpang-trans-jakarta-tahun-2019-kpi) data provided by the Jakarta government to practice our SQL skill using BigQuery and [visualization skill](https://datastudio.google.com/s/r9wW84fGnsQ) using Google Data Studio. I have included not only the SQL queries I wrote, but also the CSV files containing the answer to each question. 

## Challenge 1

In this folder, you can find the data we have to gather insight from and visualize later on, SQL queries I wrote to answer the questions from our instructor, and CSV files containing said queries' results. Here, most of the explanations are written in Indonesian, as it focuses on COVID-19 data in Indonesia.

We were also tasked to make an insightful dashboard using Google Data Studio which can be accessed [here](https://datastudio.google.com/s/jhdgdxTTt18).

## Challenge 2

This assignment challenged us to use our EDA, feature engineering, machine learning, and business knowledge to create a model which can automatically predict whether a customer is going to stop using an ISP's service by the end of the period or not. This challenge can be find in this repository, along with the train-test dataset and the final prediction for unseen data.
